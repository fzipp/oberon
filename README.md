# Project Oberon RISC Emulator

This is an emulator for the [Project Oberon (Revised Edition 2013)](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/ProjectOberon/index.html)
RISC5 processor, written in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org).
It is a port of [Peter De Wachter's emulator](https://github.com/pdewacht/oberon-risc-emu) from C to Go.

Project Oberon is a design for a complete desktop computer system from scratch by
[Niklaus Wirth](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/) and
[JÃ¼rg Gutknecht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrg_Gutknecht).
It comprises a RISC CPU, a programming language and an operating system.
